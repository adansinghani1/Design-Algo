Q2. What is the worst case runtime of candidate? Be sure to define N and justify your answer.
The worst case runtime is O(N) where N is the prefix and the runtime is O(N) because we divide the prefix by whichever letter we may need whether that may be to find to first index in order to return the whole string or the end of a string by using index.length() - 1. For example in Question 3 we are asked to use a letter such as a or c and we are able to use the prefix and get the word from our makeExample function. We are also adding and manipulating strings and we are not creating new strings that may be stack because every instance we see a string from makeExample that fits our requirements such as given the letter "a" we put out: and, andrew
